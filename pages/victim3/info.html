        <h2>Taylor</h2>
        <h3>Personal History</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;Taylor Demis was a 25-year-old camp counselor born and raised in Santa Cruz, California. They were born on June 18th, 1958 to Robert and Sarah Demis. Taylor is survived by their parents and older sister.  
          <br><br>
          &emsp;They had lived in the household with Bobby and the others while attending college. They moved out after becoming more involved with <strong><a href="./location.html">Camp Daybreak</a></strong>. Camp Daybreak is the place that Taylor worked at for a time in college and then returned after graduating. They were in the process of becoming a park ranger for Henry Cowell State Park at the time of their death.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;During the three years after Taylor moved out there was reportedly no contact between them and Bobby. Their fellow camp counselors noted that they would tell stories of how bad a housemate Bobby was. This leads investigators to believe they were not on good terms.

        <h3>Murder and Investigation</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;On the night of October 29th, 1983, Taylor’s body was found in the fishing supplies closet. Their fingers and toes had been chopped off and put in a bucket with a note that read <strong><a href="./twine.html">“Chum”</a></strong> on it. 
          <br><br>
          &emsp;Autopsy reports revealed that Taylor had died around midnight between the dates of October 28th and October 29th. Cause of death is believed to be blunt force trauma and the disfigurement was performed after their time of death.
