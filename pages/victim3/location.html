        <h2>Camp Daybreak</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Camp Daybreak is a camp that lies within the woods just outside of Santa Cruz. The collection of small cabins is a popular spot for local children to participate in summer camp. There are a number of activities that campers can enjoy. Several auxiliary closets reside around the camp to hold all of the equipment. Lots of activities are centered around the nearby Loch Lomond.

          <h3>History </h3>

          &emsp;The camp was started by local nature enthusiasts in the 60â€™s. It was intended to be a point of interest where people could appreciate nature and enjoy the outdoors. Only a few years after the camp was established they built lodges and directed the intended to be aimed at children over the general public.

          <h3>Location </h3>
          &emsp;The central bonfire, surrounded by the 6 cabins and various supply closets, is 14 miles outside of Santa Cruz on the edge of Henry Cowell State Park. Visitors will travel Highway 9, through the Santa Cruz mountains, in order to reach Camp Daybreak.
