        <h2>Chapel of the Mist</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;The Chapel of the Mist is a small A-frame log chapel located near Santa Cruz, California. The chapel is situated within a redwood forest and has recently become a popular wedding location for both locals and visitors. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;In March 1954, Reverend W. M. Noble decided to build the chapel after spending a weeklong <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vow_of_silence">vow of silence</a></strong> in the surrounding wilderness. He described the decision not as one that he consciously made, but as “a memory I uncovered. It was as if I had always known I was destined to build this chapel – I had simply forgotten, then remembered.” 
          <br>
          &emsp;He hired a small team of laborers to construct the chapel, a small bell tower, a storage shed, and a small cabin for stewards of the grounds. Noble also hired Santa Cruz glassblower Susan Lain to create 12 stained glass panels to line the walls. After 6 months of construction, the chapel opened to the public on September 12, 1954. Although Noble is a Presbyterian minister, the chapel itself is non-denominational. It is a popular spot for travelers to visit and practice their faith among the redwood trees. 
          <br>
          &emsp;Lain stewarded the chapel for 23 years, up until his death in 1977. The chapel is now kept by a local minister who requests to maintain anonymity.

        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;The entrance to the chapel is located off of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_17">CA State Route 17</a></strong>, a state highway nicknamed “Killer 17” for its narrow lanes, dense traffic, blind turns, wandering animals, and speed limit fluctuations leading to accidents and deaths. Drivers must take the 17 southbound and pull into the Chapel Turnout, marked by a sign which the groundskeepers place at the turnout during open hours. 
          <br>
          &emsp;A half mile (0.8 km) portion of the path between the turnout and the chapel grounds is unpaved and winds through the redwood forest. Standard autos are not recommended to drive this path at risk of low visibility and vehicle damage (tire punctures, paint chipping). From the parking lot, visitors are encouraged to either walk. If someone is unable to walk the dirt path, they can ring a rather odd “doorbell” system which alerts the groundskeepers to drive out on a modified golf cart. For weddings, couples typically opt to hire additional golf cart drivers to shuttle guests to the chapel.

        <h3>The “Watchful Eye”</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;Local legends claim that the Chapel of the Mist is architecturally and physically impossible. There are a number of theories surrounding this, the most notable of which is nicknamed the “Watchful Eye” of the chapel. Proponents of this theory claim that light appears to stream in from all directions simultaneously, through the stained glass windows on both sides, the large picture window behind the altar, and the frosted glass panels laid into the front doors. This light appears regardless of the direction of the sun and inclement weather conditions. Some even claim that the building appears lit from the inside at night, despite the lack of an electrical system and a strict rule against open flames within the wooden chapel. However, the groundskeepers (Rev. Noble included) maintained strict hours, prohibiting entry after dark for safety reasons. 
          <br>
          &emsp;Skeptics argue that this is a trick of the stained glass and simply reflections coming from the surrounding trees and water. Rev. Noble refused to comment on this theory, and glassblower Susan Lain has said “there’s nothing special about the glasswork I did for the chapel.” However, multiple sources have reported that the new groundskeeper remarks on the theory during wedding consultations. 
          <br>
          &emsp;Believers often claim that this light is the benevolent eyes of grateful travelers who have passed through the chapel at one point or another. The impossible light is known as the “Watchful Eye” and is said to protect those who visit. Couples often cite this light as a motivator for why they chose to be married in the chapel. Despite the theory’s popularity, no definitive photographic evidence has been circulated.
