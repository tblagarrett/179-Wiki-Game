        <h2>Cristal Domingo</h2>
        <h3>Section: Personal History</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;Cristal Domingo was a 27-year-old grant writer and artist from Watsonville, California. She was born on August 10, 1956 to Amira Roque and Juan Lucas Domingo, Filipino-Americans who migrated to Watsonville in 1951. Cristal is survived by her husband, parents, two brothers, and one sister. 
          <br><br>
          &emsp;Cristal attended the University of Santa Cruz, California, studying education with a focus on early childhood. She was originally training for a teaching certification. However, she was unable to regularly complete fieldwork after becoming a part-time caretaker for her grandparents. She lived with Bobby for three years during college, but she often stayed in Watsonville during the weekends. Occasionally, she would leave for weeks at a time, returning to campus for classes without stopping by her apartment. Although this was largely because of her caretaking responsibilities, she also expressed a desire to avoid the household, although she was careful to never specify exactly why.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;After graduation, Cristal became a grant writer for a nonprofit addressing childhood literacy and writing skills. In her personal life, she was an active zinemaker, producing both fanzines and original work. She often traveled around the bay to vend her work at house shows and DIY events. Cristal and her family were practicing Catholics throughout her life.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;On October 28, 1981, Cristal and her husband, Isaiah Lee, were married. The ceremony and reception were held at <strong><a href="./location.html">Chapel of the Mist</a></strong>. There were about 120 attendees present, mostly family, extended relatives, and close friends. Cristal and Isaiah were childhood friends and classmates in Watsonville. They attended UCSC together and first started dating in their junior year. At the time of her death, Cristal was 3 months pregnant. She had not publicly announced her pregnancy, and only family and close friends were aware.

        <h3>Section: Murder and Investigation</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;On the evening of October 28, 1983, Cristal's body was found at the Chapel of the Mist. Her body was found dismembered and displayed in a praying position <strong><a href="./twine.html">behind the altar</a></strong>, directly in front of the large picture window which was created to frame a view of the redwood forests. 
          <br><br>
          &emsp;An autopsy revealed that the time of death was several hours earlier, precisely at the same time and day as her wedding ceremony two years prior. Authorities found this particularly confounding due to the fact that there was a wedding happening on the chapel grounds this day, implying that she was killed and transported to this location sometime between the ceremony and reception. Both the groundskeepers and authorities could not attest to where the killing may have taken place, as the chapel is only accessible from one entry point and the area was crowded with guests, vendors, and employees. 
          <br><br>
          &emsp;Cristal was found in a white dress which resembled her wedding dress in shape but was evidently handmade from used bedsheets. Her body was found kneeling in a prayer position. A note was found between her hands which read “renewal.”
          <br><br>
          &emsp;Because the exact time of death (2:16 PM) being so precise to the time of her ceremony and her dress was visibly accurate to her wedding dress, it appears that the murderer had knowledge of the event or even personally attended. Bobby was not on the guest list for Cristal and Isaiah’s wedding.
